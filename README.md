# dpin-uptime

Welcome to **dpin-uptime** â€“ your first Web3 project! ðŸš€

## Overview

**dpin-uptime** is a cutting-edge uptime monitoring solution designed to leverage the decentralized power of Web3 technologies. This project is built using TypeScript, JavaScript, and CSS, with a core focus on providing reliable and transparent uptime status reporting for distributed services.

## Features

- **Decentralized Uptime Monitoring:** Harnesses Web3 protocols for trustless and transparent status verifications.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Developed primarily with TypeScript for robustness, and enhanced with JavaScript and CSS for dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple setup to monitor services and report status on-chain or via decentralized networks.
- **Customizable Dashboard:** Intuitive interface to view and manage monitored endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or bun
- MetaMask or another Web3 wallet (for interacting with decentralized networks)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ginogeo/dpin-uptime.git
cd dpin-uptime
bun install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
bun run start
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the dashboard.

## Usage

1. **Connect your Web3 wallet** to authenticate and interact with decentralized services.
2. **Add endpoints/services** you want to monitor.
3. **View uptime status** and historical reports on the dashboard.
4. **Configure alerts** (coming soon!) for real-time notifications.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Main language for codebase
- **JavaScript**: Supplementary scripting
- **CSS**: Styling and layout
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**: Blockchain interactions (add details based on actual usage)
- **React** (if applicable): UI framework
- **Node.js**: Backend and tooling
